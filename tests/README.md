# µcad test driver

This crate provides the µcad test driver.
It generates tests from markdown files.

This assures that documentation and tests are always in sync.

Having this tool, we can make tested code examples which produce:

* Proper test results next to the documentation
* SVG/STL Outputs which will be displayed within documentation
* Clear log for every test (e.g. [../books/tutorials/src/lego_brick/part/.test/first_version.log])
* A list of all [tests](../books/tests/src/test_list.md)
