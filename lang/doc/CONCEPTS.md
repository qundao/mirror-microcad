## µcad Rules

To stay on course while continuing development of µcad we have expressed some rules that may guide us:

1. µcad is a declarative markup language. This means µcad avoids imperative control flow statements: for, while, goto.
2. Complex generic functionalities (like generating objects or mathematical functionalities)
   shall be put into *builtin libraries* instead of implementing them within µcad itself.
3. The *standard library* shall implement a convenient interface to the builtin library.
4. µcad enforces a strict *modular concept* to improve code quality.
5. Explicit naming of *arguments* (within in *calls*) is encouraged.
6. Explicit writing of *units* at *values* is forced.

## The Build Process

The *µcad* interpreter runs programs which generate geometry files.
The processing of *µcad* source code files into output files can be divided into separate phases:

![phases](images/phases.svg)

### Parsing Phase

In the parsing phase one source file is read into a *syntax tree* by using the [*µcad* grammar](../lang/grammar.pest).
Any errors which occur within the parsing phase are related to file access or syntax.

### Resolving Phase

In the resolving phase, the following steps are done:

1. the search paths will be recursively scanned for any external µcad files
2. all symbols (e,g, parts, functions, constants and modules) in the source file will be put into a symbol tree

At the end all dependent files are loaded and syntax definitions are placed in the symbol tree and everything can be found by it's qualified name.

### Evaluation Phase

In the evaluation phase, the *syntax tree*  will be processed into the *object node tree*
which is a structured representation of the geometry.
While this phase the following things will be done:

- expressions will be calculated
- functions will be called
- parts will generate *object nodes*
- user messages will be output on console

Any errors which occur within the evaluation phase are related to semantic issues.

### Export Phase

In the export phase the *object nodes* will be taken to generate 2D or 3D output files
(e.g. *SVG* or *STL*).
While this phase the following things will be done:

- geometric operations will be processed
- geometries will be rendered
- the output files will be written

Any errors which occur within the export phase are related to geometrical processing or file access.

### Viewing

**Note**: Currently *µcad* does not have any available viewer.

The viewing phase generates images which can be shown to visualize *object nodes* (e.g. in an IDE).
Any errors which occur here are related to geometrical processing.

| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Assignment | *value*           | *value*           | `v = ..;`  | -                     |
| Function   | *values*          | *value*           | `f(..);`   | `fn f(..) { .. }`     |

## Coding Conventions

### Naming

| Element   | Example              | Format                |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| type      | `MyType`             | pascal case           |
| const     | `const MY_CONST = 1` | upper case snake case |
| module    | `mod my_lib`         | snake case            |
| function  | `fn my_func`         | snake case            |
| sketch    | `sketch MyBench`     | pascal case           |
| part      | `part MyBench`       | pascal case           |
| operation | `op my_bench`        | snake case            |
| variables | `my_var = 1`         | snake case            |
