This is the language module of microcad which includes parsing, resolving and evaluating microcad code.

To use this you need to install an application like the crate [microcad](https://crates.io/crates/microcad) which offers a command line interface to this library.

An intro page about the microcad language can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/microcad/microcad/src/branch/main/README.md).
