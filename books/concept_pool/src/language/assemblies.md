# Assembly Benches

Currently µcad produces 2D sketches and 3D parts.
We would like to create another abstraction layer above sketches & parts: assembly benches
Assembly benches put together parts.
You may put a screw into a screw thread (maybe with constrains?) or assemble a case which is made out of several parts.
Also you may use connectors and joints (from specialized libraries) to put them together.
