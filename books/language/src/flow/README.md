# Program Flow

µcad is a programming language designed for generating 2D and 3D models.
It deliberately avoids common programming constructs such as loops or mutable variables,
but instead offers an alternative concept we call [Multiplicity](calls/multiplicity.md).

This chapter explains how program flow in µcad works.
