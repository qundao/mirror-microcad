# Special Characters

µcad is already using a Unicode character in its name and it allows even more Unicode
to improve readability of scientific unit notations within the source code.

[Sadly](https://codeberg.org/microcad/microcad/issues/81) the majority of keyboards do not support some of them.
In this case you may easily replace the special characters like shown in the
following table.

| Original Character | Replacement |  Example   |  Equivalent   | Usage                            |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :--------: | :-----------: | -------------------------------- |
|        `µ`         |  `m`, `u`   |   `µcad`   | `mcad`,`ucad` | file extension, markdown testing |
|        `µ`         |     `u`     | `µm`, `µl` |  `um`, `ul`   | micro prefix in metric units     |
|        `°`         |    `deg`    |    `3°`    |    `3deg`     | angle unit                       |
|        `²`         |     `2`     |   `3m²`    |     `3m2`     | area units                       |
|        `³`         |     `3`     |   `3m³`    |     `3m3`     | volume units                     |
