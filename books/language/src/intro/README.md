# Introduction

The *µcad programming language* is a purely declarative so-called *markup
programming language* to describe geometries.
This means that a µcad program can be evaluated (like a mathematical equation).
The result is a model tree that can be rendered into a graphical output and can be exported into a file.

## Purpose of this document

This document is meant as an explaining reference of all language features of µcad.
Each chapter will explain a feature and its concepts and together with code examples.

The code examples are automatically tested, unless they are marked as `todo`.
This assures that all explained features work as expected.
