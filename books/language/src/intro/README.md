# Introduction

The *µcad programming language* is purely declarative so-called *markup
programming language*, which means that a µcad program can be evaluated like a
mathematical equation, resulting in a graphical output.

## Purpose of this document

This document is meant as a explaining reference of all features of microcad.
So chapter-wise this book will explain them around some example code.
This example code is automatically tested and gives us a bit of a guarantee,
that those features we explain here, work like we say.
