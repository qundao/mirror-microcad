# Workbenches

*Workbenches* are essential language elements in µcad for creating and constructing 2D
[*sketches*](sketches.md), 3D [*parts*](parts.md), or performing [*operations*](operations.md) on
them.
Every *workbench* is initialized with a [*building plan*](building_plan.md)
from which it generates 2D or 3D *models*.

In the following pages, you will first learn about the elements that compose
a workbench of any type.
Then, we will explore the different types of workbenches.
