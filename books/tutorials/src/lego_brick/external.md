# File module

Let's assume we want to use the `LegoBrick` from a different source file inside your project.

Fortunately, this is simple!
We just have to create a second file `my_brick.µcad`:

```sh
microcad create my_brick
```

The directory structure is supposed to contain these files:

```plain
lego_brick.µcad
my_brick.µcad
```

Let's add the following content to the `my_brick.µcad` file to
create a few bricks with different parameters:

```µcad
mod lego_brick;

use lego_brick::*;

// 2x2 double height
double_2x2 = LegoBrick(rows = 2, columns = 2, base_height = 9.6mm * 2);

// 4x2 single height
single_4x2 = LegoBrick(rows = 4, columns = 2);

// 3x2 one-third height
third_3x2 = LegoBrick(rows = 3, columns = 2, base_height = 3.2mm);

// generate geometry placing all elements side by side
use std::ops::translate;

single_4x2;
double_2x2.translate(y = -40mm);
third_3x2.translate(y = 40mm);
```

As you can see in the first line we use a `mod` statement to load our external module `lego_brick`.

## Visibility

To make this work, we also need to change one line in our final part:

```µcad
pub part LegoBrick(rows = 2, columns = 4, base_height = 9.6mm) {
```

Here we add the keyword `pub` to make `LegoBrick` visible from outside modules (like our `my_brick.µcad`):

Now you can export `my_brick.µcad` to generate the result of our tutorial.
