# Finish the struts

Maybe you already question yourself if there is something similar to `std::geo2d::Frame()` for our circles?

And yes there is, and it's called `std::geo2d::Ring`.
So let's shorten our strut code a last time:

[![test](.test/ring.svg)](.test/ring.log)

```µcad,ring
use std::geo2d::*;
use std::ops::*;

Ring(outer_diameter = 6.51mm, inner_diameter = 4.8mm)
    .translate(x = [-1..1] * 8mm);
```

At this point, we are almost finished with the base.
We just have to find a way to combine frame and structs.
