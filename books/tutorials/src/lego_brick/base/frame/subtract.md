# Subtract

Until now, we have two rectangles which are generated within the same file but to build a frame, we have to combine them.

## Grouping statements

The first step is to bundle the rectangles into a *group* with curly brackets `{}`.
So let's put some around the frame's rectangles.

[![test](.test/group.svg)](.test/group.log)

```µcad,group
thickness = 1.2mm;
width = 31.8mm;
height = 15.8mm;
{
    std::geo2d::Rect(width, height);
    std::geo2d::Rect(width = width - 2 * thickness, height = height - 2 * thickness);
}
```

As you can see, there is no `;` after the braces.

The visual output did not change by using the group braces.
However, now we can combine both rectangles by using an *operation*.

## Manipulate geometry with *Operations*

In µcad, the operation to *subtract a geometry* from one another is called [`subtract`](../../../../../../doc/libs/std/ops/subtract.md).
In our case, we want to subtract the *outer part* by the *inner part* in our frame group:

[![test](.test/subtract.svg)](.test/subtract.log)

```µcad,subtract
thickness = 1.2mm;
width = 31.8mm;
height = 15.8mm;
{
    std::geo2d::Rect(width, height);
    std::geo2d::Rect(width = width - 2 * thickness, height = height - 2 * thickness);
}.std::ops::subtract(); // Apply the operation.
```

Now the semicolon is back, because we added the operation.
