# Program Structure

The microcad language is about parametrization of more or less complex 2D and 3D models.

It does not know any looping instead it uses [Multiplicity](../concepts/multiplicity.md) to get the
effect of getting many items from one.
There also are no mutable variables so you cannot count a number or even store a state.

So some things maybe different compared to other programming languages you might know.
Everything in microcad is more parameterization and less programming.

So let's dive into the structure of a microcad program.
