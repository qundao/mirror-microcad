# Program Structure

Microcad is a programming language designed for generating 2D and 3D models.
It deliberately avoids common programming constructs such as loops or mutable variables,
but instead offers an alternative concept we call [Multiplicity](../concepts/multiplicity.md).

A microcad program consists of the following core elements:

- [Source Files](source_file.md)  
- [Modules](modules/README.md)  
- [Workbenches](workbenches/README.md)  
- [Functions](functions.md)

Each of these elements can contain various statements.
Both the elements themselves and their statements are explained in the following section.
