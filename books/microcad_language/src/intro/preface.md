# Preface

In the 2010s there was a time where 3D printing became available for almost everyone in Makerspaces and at home.
People were building DIY printers and started to program controllers to control them.
Those programmers once needed a platform to create 3D objects they can print.
In this time [someone](https://github.com/kintel) just invented a programming language for those people who are
working with their keyboards instead of using a mouse or a graphic tablet.

This language was called [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad) and it was widely used since then
and a great success.

We (the founders of microcad) loved it too and did a lot of "thingies" with it.
But as experienced software engineers we also had some criticism.
OpenSCAD's language is easy to learn and looks a little like common C programs.

But we felt, like the language itself could:

- generally be more specialized in creating graphics,
- ease it to modularize programs,
- use strict types and units,
- be more like *rust* rather like *C*,
- have a proper library concept,
- have plugins which are written in other languages,
- come up with a more helpful visualization.

So after getting close to rust in the last years we started microcad as a fun project and then
got selected for a funding for the visualization plugin in 2025.

After more than a year of work we have developed some concepts and have realized them.
